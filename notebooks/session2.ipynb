    "# Session 2: Working with LLM Coding Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment explores how large language models function as coding agents within integrated development environments. You'll work with climate emissions data to understand both the capabilities and limitations of LLM-assisted data analysis, with particular attention to how execution environment shapes what's possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Through structured exercises with the OWID CO2 dataset, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinguish** between chat-based LLM interfaces and coding agents with local execution capabilities\n",
    "- **Develop** fluency in specifying data operations through natural language while understanding the underlying computational patterns\n",
    "- **Evaluate** the boundary between tasks coding agents handle autonomously versus those requiring human guidance\n",
    "- **Assess** when programmatic approaches offer advantages over manual analysis methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Execution Environment Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The same foundation model—Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4, or similar—exhibits markedly different capabilities depending on its execution context. A browser-based chat interface can generate syntactically correct code but lacks the infrastructure to execute, test, and refine it. The model generates a response and moves on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a coding agent operating within VS Code has access to a Python interpreter, your installed packages, the filesystem, and terminal. This enables an iterative cycle: execute code, parse errors or unexpected output, modify the approach, and re-execute. The model maintains context across this loop, accumulating information about what works in your specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architectural difference—not model sophistication—determines whether you can request \"analyze emissions trends by region\" and receive working results, or whether you must manually execute generated code, diagnose failures, and prompt for corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with OWID Climate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our World in Data maintains a comprehensive CO2 emissions dataset with country-level historical data, fuel source breakdowns, and economic indicators. The dataset's accessible format (direct CSV URL, documented schema, standard tabular structure) makes it appropriate for examining how coding agents handle common analytical workflows: filtering, aggregation, reshaping, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role is to specify analyses in natural language and observe how the coding agent approaches each task. Note what it handles autonomously, where it requires clarification, what libraries it selects, and how it recovers from errors."
