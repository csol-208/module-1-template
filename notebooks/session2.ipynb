    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "- Experience what AI handles easily vs where it struggles\n",
    "- Learn to scaffold complex problems AI can't solve alone\n",
    "- Work with real, messy climate data at increasing complexity\n",
    "- Develop intuition for when to use agent mode vs when you need to lead\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Philosophy:**\n",
    "You're training to be an AI power user, not to avoid AI. We want you to see AI's limits by pushing them, not by artificial constraints. The tasks progress from trivial to genuinely difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**🟢 Easy Problems** - AI crushes these. Watch how agent mode iterates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🟡 Moderate Problems** - AI needs guidance. You'll hit documentation gaps and schema complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔴 Hard Problems** - AI can help with pieces but YOU must lead. Requires domain knowledge and judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your job:** Document where the transitions happen. When does AI stop being autonomous? What makes a problem hard for AI?"
