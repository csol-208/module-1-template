    "# Session 3: Data Infrastructure and Multi-Source Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment shifts from the well-curated OWID interface you worked with in Session 2 to a more realistic scenario: working with environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) data that tracks emissions through global supply chains. You'll encounter data in its original archival format, then work with the same data after engineering improvements, examining how infrastructure choices affect both human and automated workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Exiobase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exiobase** is a multi-regional, environmentally-extended input-output (MRIO) database tracking economic activity and environmental impacts across global supply chains. Unlike OWID's aggregated national totals, Exiobase provides sectoral resolution: emissions from electricity generation, transport, manufacturing, agriculture, and hundreds of other economic activities across 49 regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Structure**: Input-output tables linking inter-industry flows (who sells to whom) with environmental extensions (emissions per unit of output)\n",
    "- **Coverage**: 163 industries × 49 regions × environmental pressures including CO₂, CH₄, land use, water consumption\n",
    "- **Temporal scope**: Annual tables from 1995-2022\n",
    "- **Applications**: Consumption-based emissions accounting, supply chain analysis, trade embodied emissions, sectoral decarbonization pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological note**: MRIO models allocate emissions to final consumers rather than production locations. A smartphone manufactured in China but consumed in the US would have emissions attributed differently in Exiobase (consumption-based) versus OWID (territorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters for data work**: Exiobase represents a class of datasets common in environmental research—scientifically rigorous, methodologically complex, and historically difficult to access. Recent cloud-optimized formats have improved accessibility, but challenges around schema complexity and domain knowledge requirements remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",

    "\n",
    "### Background: The Original Exiobase Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Exiobase was originally published following academic data sharing conventions:\n",
    "- **Repository**: Zenodo (open science platform, DOI-based versioning)\n",
    "- **Format**: ZIP archives containing CSV matrices and metadata files\n",
    "- **Structure**: Separate files for monetary flows, environmental extensions, concordance tables\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Academic papers, technical reports, scattered README files\n",
    "- **Access pattern**: Download entire archives (hundreds of MB), extract locally, reconstruct table relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution model works well for researchers conducting deep analyses who will spend weeks with the data. It creates friction for exploratory work or automated pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive and Technical Barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "**For human analysts:**\n",
    "- Understanding MRIO structure requires methodological background\n",
    "- Multiple files must be combined correctly (matrix multiplication, proper indexing)\n",
    "- Classification systems (ISIC, NACE, CPA) require domain knowledge\n",
    "- Data cleaning and reshaping before analysis can begin\n",
    "\n",
    "**For coding agents:**\n",
    "- Zenodo requires authentication or interactive download (no direct URL to data)\n",
    "- ZIP extraction and file navigation with unclear naming conventions\n",
    "- Schema inference from academic documentation rather than formal standards\n",
    "- Limited training data representation (specialized domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1: Attempt to Load Exiobase (Original)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Experience the access friction in the original distribution model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**: \n",
    "1. Starting point: https://zenodo.org/communities/exiobase/\n",
    "2. Task your coding agent with loading CO₂ emissions data by sector and region for a recent year\n",
    "3. Observe what happens—expect multiple failure modes\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you're testing**: Can a coding agent navigate academic data repositories, infer correct file structures, and reconstruct multi-file databases autonomously?"

    "**Required Components:**\n",
    "1. Executed notebook with all code cells producing output\n",
    "2. Completed diagnostic analyses (Parts 1-2)\n",
    "3. Methodological investigation (Part 3)\n",
    "4. Synthesis analysis (Part 4) with supporting visualization(s)\n",
    "5. Synthesis reflection (Part 5)\n",

    "**Evaluation Framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Diagnostic Insight (30%)*  \n",
    "Quality of reflection on access barriers and infrastructure effects. Do you understand how format choices constrain workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Technical Execution (25%)*  \n",
    "Code quality, appropriate methods, correct calculations. Does your analysis run and produce valid results?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Methodological Reasoning (25%)*  \n",
    "Part 3 investigation depth and Part 4 analytical rigor. Can you identify why datasets disagree and make defensible methodological choices?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Critical Interpretation (20%)*  \n",
    "Do you distinguish findings from limitations? Can you assess when to trust coding agent output versus when to verify?\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment evaluates your capacity to work with complex data infrastructure and make methodological judgments—skills essential for original research where clean, documented datasets don't exist."
